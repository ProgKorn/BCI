# BCI
Bayesian Causal Inference usage to diagnose and understand Major Depressive Disorder.
<br/> The current associated study can be found https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AorPgls7WNlbUl-t3Z5v_FhRAFpOzsM1/view?usp=sharing

# How to use
Please refer to the comments in the code and rename the paths for the datasets, CSVs and folders according to your setup. Ensure the pkl is extracted and ensure its path is correct in the code. If additional data is required for testing, ensure it is placed in the correct folder. 
If attempting to rebuild and train the algorithm, convert the EEG data and features into a CSV after processing to save time and resources.

# Datasets
